<p>the VM-1 [faʊ̯ ɛm aɪ̯ns] (or german: <em>Video Mischer Eins</em>) is currently in development. If you want to want to stay in the loop, join our community below.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it-exactly">what is it exactly?</h2>
<p>we like to think of it as a <mark><i>visual instrument</i></mark>. just like a musical instrument - but for visuals. you can <mark>play</mark> and <mark>blend</mark> pre-recorded <mark>videos</mark> with other videos or <mark>live-cameras</mark>, adding effects and your unique style.</p>
<p>we want to enable artists with no or little technical skills to create high quality film content on stage. using the VM-1 will raise the level of their live video shows by focusing on playful creativity and visual aesthetics. VM-1 is made for, but not limited to, low budget live events.</p>

<ul>
<li>the VM-1 is super <mark>easy and fun to use</mark>.</li>

<h5>a traditional setup</h5>

a traditional setup with projectors and live cameras needs a laptop, hdmi-capture-devices and a software (like vvvv, isadora, resolume, touch-designer, tooll3, you-name-it).

this works perfectly with the downside that it's rather expensive and a bit more complicated to learn it's usage.

we will not address how the cables are laid here.

<h5>vm-1 setup</h5>

the VM-1 has it all-in-one. plug in almost any cameras and use it for your upcoming live show with two (big) projectors, mixing it with your pre-produced videos - without any laptop or other gear. simply press a button and the selected video or live-input will be played.

out of a sudden, even the cables are laid nicely.

to be honest, we're still amazed that this is even possible with a tiny computer like the raspberry pi.

<!-- what we learned from the music making industry is, that - although there are tons of daws and vsts to make music - many musicians like the feeling of having an instrument that's *not their laptop*. you get creative within the limitations of this instrument and get inspired by the sound, haptics and user experience their creators put on it. -->
