I have seen video on stage before. what's so special about the VM-1? the VM-1 is super easy and fun to use . it's cheaper than traditional setups. it's open source . there is afaik no comparable product on the market. let's have a look at this in detail: a traditional setup a traditional setup with projectors and live cameras needs a laptop, hdmi-capture-devices and a software (like vvvv, isadora, resolume, touch-designer, tooll3, you-name-it). this works perfectly with the downside that it's rather expensive and a bit more complicated to learn it's usage. a traditional setup with two cameras and two projectors.
